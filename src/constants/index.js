with paying for the cost of a service (like SoundCloud) and I also do have a
server just sitting here anyways. So this is likely to be the place that tracks
will be added from now on. It will also at some point contain the entirety of
all of my music.`

  and also lowered the maximum data I am allowed to have on a free account. I do not
  endorse most of this music as I think most of it isn't that good and in all honesty
  is kind of embarassing; however, much of it was created before I was an adult.... so...
  I think that should be taken into acccount when listening to the trash.`

export const CHIRBIT = `This was a solution to get rid of SoundCloud at one point but I ended up abandoning it
rather quickly since there was no community around it and the UI was poor.
Also I have to use their embedded player and they have no API... so that sucks.`

export const MIXCLOUD = `As the name suggests this is for only mixes. They don't seem to have problems with
copywrites. I will probably continue to update this in the future if I release any more.
Additionally: for some reason the player has a hard time swapping songs. So if it doesn't load try it again.`
