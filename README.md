## General Information

A small personal React site dedicated to aggrigating all music I have created. It demonstrates the ability to read data from both APIs and JSON files (where no API exists) and outputting the details into components. It also serves as a minor demonstration of capability.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Current Completion Status

Incomplete initial release: awaiting personal API to consume for Self Hosting tab and Track CRUD modal.

## Next Release TODO
Cleaner and nicer looking track cards preferablly with animations.
Lazy loading tabs.
